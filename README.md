# Purpura oazo

![Epic crab inside a purple oasis](./docs/front.jpg)

Purpura oazo, translated to Purple oasis, is a project for a multipurpose scalable and modular discord bot, all written in the only language approved by god, witch here is a crab, Rust.

I am legally obligated to say that, that was a joke.

I am currently learning how to use GitHub correctly, so until I know how to do it, or unlock friends that know how to, I will just present to you my current objectives. 

## Current objectives

- [x] Create a cache around server data, for security purposes inside SurrealDB.
- [ ] Create a modular API around events.
  - [ ] Create the Lua API to embed custom logic.
    > This is intended for community plugins. And isn't a priority. Because I'm stupid.
- [ ] Process heavy load tasks separately using a task scheduler.
- [ ] Create a user interface using Leptos-rs

The features, such as welcome images and such, will be worked on after the basic runtime elements are developed.
Including the UI to control them.
